## Why?

I want to keep track of what I learn each day, so I decided to experiment a little bit with Netlify CMS and Gatsby. I really like how easy it is to add new blog posts so in the future I'm thinking about combining this journal with my portfolio website.

I'm not planning on writing much in this journal, mostly it's just going to be a bullet lists with the stuff that I was learning on a particular day.
